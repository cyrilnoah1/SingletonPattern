The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one
instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

In this example, we create a PiggyBank class that uses the
Singleton Pattern in order to make sure that only one
instance of piggy bank is created. Where it is used to
access the piggy bank, and then take or add money.
